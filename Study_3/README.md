## Overview

## My process

Again, I did used the box technique to study the design file and discover the sections inside the layout. Although, it was easy to discover the sections, it was really hard to build the style of the page. I believe this difficult came since I haven't understood so well some key concepts of the usage of the CSS and some properties of it. So, I'm not very satisfied with the stylesheet, I believe it's very confused and wasn't done correctly.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this exercise, I really improved my perception on how to build the structure the HTML page, especially on how to use the div tag on a more accurate way. However, the principal aspect I learned was on to centralize the objects using the flex display. I always forget to use it, and using it to centralize the card was really helpful. It was made with the justify-content property too:

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

### Continued development

It's the most difficult design layout in which I tried to build until now. I'm not very happy with the result, so I'll tried to build some others layout a little bit more easier to make, and, after I feel confortable with the CSS concepts, I'll jump to more harder ones.

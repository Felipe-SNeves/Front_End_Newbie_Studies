## Overview

## My process

On this exercise, I fixed the basic concepts about position, display and how useful is the use of the div tag. Especially, on the link of the second box of the card. I used a div tag to colorize the background like a buttom and with the div it was easy to centralize the text on the buttom. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I reforced the concepts of the position, display and float properties to arrange the elements on the page. Also, it showed me the importance to use the div tag correctly.

### Continued development

On the next exercise, I must try to introduce new concepts to work, like CSS grid which I have never used and try to use a little bit more the cascade properties.

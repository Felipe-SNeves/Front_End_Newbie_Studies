# Front End Newbie Studies

## Purpose

Hi, I use this repo to upload some of my front end development studies. I'm not a creative or design person, soo, essentially, everything here looks terrible and messy. Currently, I wrote some CSS notes, and with it, I'm trying to create a more assertive notion of front end development!

I created a GitHub Pages's environment, soo everyone can see how I'm doing with this task... Here goes the links:

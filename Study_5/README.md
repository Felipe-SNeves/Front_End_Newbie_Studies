## Overview

## My process

On this exercise, I tried something new, it's the first exercise in which I used Javascript. I used it to produce the effects of display the alert messages when an user doesn't fill correctly the form. I don't know if I built the alert icon effect correctly, I believe that I made in a wrong way, however, every single place in which I tried to search an apropriate way to do it, showed different soluctions. Some of then were pretty elegant, altought I don't understand well them, on the other hand, others were made in ways in which I think is wrong, my solution included.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Pure Javascript

### What I learned

I finally had time to study the use of Javascript without any framework. I already used it with JQuery, Angular and React, although, I didn't understand the basics concepts about the language since I didn't have the opportunity to study it without any library or framework. That study showed to me why these frameworks help a lot when we need to accoplate some state or dinamic on the page.

### Continued development

I didn't do the others exercise to synthetize the CSS concepts yet. I'll do them on the sequence, and after them I'll return to the pure JS study.
